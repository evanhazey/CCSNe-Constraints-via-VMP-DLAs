QSO: Name of the quasar that the DLA is pointed towards. The numbers refer to the right ascension and declination of the quasar (and hence, the DLA)
QSOFullName: SIMBAD/NED compatible name of quasar
z_abs: Redshift of the DLA
logNH: Log base 10 of the hydrogen column density (# atoms/square centimeter)
e_logNH: Logarithmic error in the measurement of log(NH)
l_[X/H]: Limit of [X/H] measurement; '=' is normal, '<' is upper limit, and 'x' means there is no measurement 
[X/H]: Measurement of [X/H] (normalized to Asplund+2009 solar scale)
e_[X/H]: Error (+/-) in the [X/H] measurement; if l_[X/H] == '<' or 'x' then there is no e_[X/H]
Instrument: Instrument(s) used to obtain spectra/measure abundance
Ref: Reference(s) code number for each source (see code maps in README in main directory)
