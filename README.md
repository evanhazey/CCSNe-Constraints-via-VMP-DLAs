Data used in the VMP DLA Paper (arxiv:2108.00659}

*_analysis.fits contains only the abundance measurements used in our analysis (i.e., no duplicates). Will be available in the journal (soon to be accepted).

*_full.fits contains duplicate measurements for the systems which abundances were determined by multiple authors (only availble here)
